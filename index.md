## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at <a href="https://gsai.kaist.ac.kr/">Graduate School of AI, KAIST</a>, where I also completed my masterâ€™s degreeunder the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://bispl.weebly.com/professor.html">Jong Chul Ye</a>.

I am interested in the **controllability** of advanced generative AI models, including diffusion models and large language models (LLMs). My recent research explores **efficient guidance** methods, such as training-free approaches and general-purpose strategies.
