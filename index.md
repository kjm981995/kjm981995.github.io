## About Me

<p style="font-size: 16px;">
I am a Ph.D. student at <a href="https://gsai.kaist.ac.kr/">Graduate School of AI, KAIST</a>, where I also completed my masterâ€™s degree under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://bispl.weebly.com/professor.html">Jong Chul Ye</a>.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">
My research focuses on <strong>controllable generative AI</strong>, exploring ways to steer the outputs of advanced models such as diffusion models and large language models (LLMs) efficiently. I work at the intersection of generative modeling, trajectory-level optimization, and black-box guidance, with the goal of making generative AI more controllable and interpretable.

## My work trajectory

- How can Diffusion Models (DMs) connect two arbitrary distributions? (**[P1]**)
- Can Consistency Trajectory Models (CTMs) be generalized to connect arbitrary distributions? (**[C1]**)
- How can Video DMs generate more natural motion through guidance? (**[C3]**)
- Do the samples from DMs provide meaningful directions, as in XAI? (**[C2]**)
- Can the samples from DMs serve as guidance? (**[C4]**)
- Do LLMs serve as guidance in RL approaches? (**[P2]**)
- Can DMs edit images to maximize reward in a training-free manner? (**[P3]**)
